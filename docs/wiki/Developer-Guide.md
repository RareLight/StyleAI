# Developer Guide

Welcome to the StyleAI Developer Guide! This document provides upstream maintainers and curious contributors with an overview of the recent massive architectural refactoring, and details on how to build and extend the plugin.

## 1. Global API Envelope

Every single communication between the Lua plugin and the Python backend is strictly wrapped in a JSON envelope. This ensures the frontend never crashes due to unhandled API changes and allows graceful surfacing of warnings.

**Standard Response Format:**
```json
{
  "results": { ... },
  "error": null,
  "warning": "Optional warning string that Lightroom should display."
}
```
*When adding new endpoints to `server/src/routes/`, ALWAYS use the `@api_envelope` decorator (or manually wrap your response).*

## 2. Asynchronous Lua Pipeline (`Pipeline.lua`)

To ensure Lightroom never hangs during batch processing, we abstracted all photo loops into `components/Pipeline.lua`.

**Key Features:**
- `Pipeline.runSequentialBatch(photos, progressScope, options, processFn)`
- Automatically wraps your `processFn` in an `LrTasks.pcall` to catch native crashes.
- Collects and tabulates successes and errors, returning them in a unified summary structure.
- When building new features that iterate over selected photos, ALWAYS use this pipeline.

## 3. SQLite Schema Migrations (`migrations/`)

StyleAI now uses a custom, lightweight Python migration engine to manage SQLite schema evolution without relying on heavy frameworks like Alembic.

**How to add a database column:**
1. Create a new Python file in `server/src/migrations/versions/` named `00X_description.py`.
2. Define a single `def upgrade(conn: sqlite3.Connection):` function.
3. Use the `conn` object to execute your `ALTER TABLE` statements.
4. The backend will automatically apply it the next time Lightroom binds to the server.

*Example:* See `003_add_user_style_name.py` for how we added custom style renaming capabilities.

## 4. LLM Provider Abstraction (`providers/`)

The backend is completely provider-agnostic. Whether a user connects to a local `Ollama` instance or cloud `Gemini`, the core logic never changes.

- All providers inherit from `LLMProvider(ABC)`.
- Use the `get_analysis_service(config)` factory function to obtain the active provider based on the user's settings.
- To add a new provider (e.g. Anthropic Claude), simply subclass `LLMProvider` and implement `generate_metadata` and `test_connection`.

## 5. Security & Credentials

- **Backend Binding:** In production, the Flask server unconditionally binds to `127.0.0.1` to prevent network exposure.
- **Keychain Storage:** We completely purged plaintext API keys from `Preferences.agprefs`. All API keys are securely retrieved via the native `LrPasswords` module in Lua. Never log or store API keys in plaintext files.

## 6. Observability

- **Diagnostic Reports:** Instead of asking users to zip up `.log` files, they can click "Generate Diagnostic Report" in the Lightroom Plugin Manager. This uses `TaskDiagnostics.lua` to pull backend `/health` and `/logs`, rendering a beautiful HTML file for instant browser viewing.

## 7. Pitfalls & C-Stack Overflows

Lightroom SDK plugins are prone to C-stack overflows if coroutine yields and database transactions are mismanaged.
- **NEVER yield inside a database transaction:** Do not call `LrTasks.yield()` inside `withWriteAccessDo` or `withPrivateWriteAccessDo` closures. Doing so suspends the Lua coroutine while holding a C-level SQLite transaction lock. The orphaned C-stack frames will rapidly accumulate and crash Lightroom.
- **The macOS Spin-Lock:** Using the pattern `if MAC_ENV then LrTasks.yield() else LrTasks.sleep(0.1) end` is a dangerous anti-pattern. On macOS, `LrTasks.yield()` without a subsequent sleep does NOT reliably return control to the Lightroom UI loop. During heavy batch processing, this causes C-stack buildup. ALWAYS use `LrTasks.yield(); LrTasks.sleep(0.01)` regardless of OS to guarantee the transaction stack flushes.
- **Transaction Bloat:** When applying multiple edits or metadata properties to a photo, combine them into a single `withWriteAccessDo` block. Firing multiple sequential database transactions per-photo exponentially increases SQLite overhead and stack pressure during batch operations.

## 8. Python Backend Memory Efficiency

When processing images in Python, particularly 1024px JPEGs received from Lightroom:
- **Lazy Downsampling:** ALWAYS call `image.thumbnail()` BEFORE calling `.convert("RGB")`. Calling `.convert("RGB")` on a full-resolution JPEG forces Pillow to decode and allocate the entire uncompressed 3-channel array in memory (which can consume hundreds of megabytes) before downsizing. `thumbnail()` allows Pillow to decode natively at a lower resolution, drastically reducing RAM footprints.
- **16-bit TIFF Bracketing:** The AI Edit bracket generation works with 16-bit ProPhoto RGB TIFFs. To prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crashes during concurrent processing, TIFF concurrency is strictly capped to the number of CPU threads via `BRACKET_SEMAPHORE` in `image_processing.py`.

## 9. Signature Styles Export

Users can now export their learned Signature Styles directly to Lightroom Classic Develop Presets. The backend aggregates the style parameters into Adobe XMP format and generates an importable `.zip` file on the fly via `preset_generator.py`.
